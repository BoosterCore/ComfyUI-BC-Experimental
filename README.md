# ComfyUI-BC-Experimental
****
## 简介
****
ComfyUI-BC-Experimental这个项目是为了学习 Python 编程而创建的，并希望与开源社区分享我在探索这一技能过程中的一些心得。   
作为一名业余爱好者，我没有学过编程，亦没有 Python 基础，暂时也没有时间和精力进行系统学习，所以想借助开源社区以及AI大语言模型帮我叩开编程的大门。   
假如您恰巧与我情况类似，欢迎切磋！假如您是 Python 老手，请不吝赐教！

## Overview
****
This project, ComfyUI-BC-Experimental, was created to learn the basics of Python programming and share some insights gained during this process with the open-source community.   
As an amateur enthusiast, I haven't learned programming and also don't have a foundation in Python; for the time being, I lack both the time and energy to engage in systematic learning. Therefore, I'd like to rely on open-source communities as well as AI large language models to help me break into the world of programming.   
If you just happen to be in a similar situation to mine, I'd welcome the opportunity for mutual improvement! If you're a master of Python, please don't hesitate to share your expertise!
